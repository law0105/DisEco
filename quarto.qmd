**1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**

A sample size of 59 is necessary.

**2)Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

Identifying a 1% prevalence at a 95% confidence level requires at a sample size of at least 299, while identifying a prevalence of 2% at a 99% confidence level requires 229, a difference of 70 samples.

**3) You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is** \<1%.

[**4)An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and Russell counties).\
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.**]{.underline}

Chambers - 26.7% prevalence, 95% CL - Lower CL 13.1%, Upper CL 44.9%

Lee - 20.0% prevalence, 95% CL - Lower CL 14.3%, Upper CL 27.3%

Russell - 3.1% prevalence, 95% CL - Lower CL 0.9%, Upper CL 8.7%\

**b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.**

The p-value is \<0.0001 suggesting that the difference is statistically significant.

**5) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected\
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
in the pond (including previously infected fish).\
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.**\
Day 1 - 3/60, 0.05 cases per fish-day

Day 2 - 1/57, 0.018 cases per fish-day

Day 5 - 9/49, 0.184 cases per fish-day

**b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?**\
Day 3 - 7/60, 11.7% prevalence

Day 5 - 20/60, 33.3% prevalence

**c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?**\
Day 1
