**1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**

A sample size of 59 is necessary.

**2)Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

Identifying a 1% prevalence at a 95% confidence level requires at a sample size of at least 299, while identifying a prevalence of 2% at a 99% confidence level requires 229, a difference of 70 samples.

**3) You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is** \<1%.

[**4)An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and Russell counties).\
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.**]{.underline}

Chambers - 26.7% prevalence, 95% CL - Lower CL 13.1%, Upper CL 44.9%

Lee - 20.0% prevalence, 95% CL - Lower CL 14.3%, Upper CL 27.3%

Russell - 3.1% prevalence, 95% CL - Lower CL 0.9%, Upper CL 8.7%\

**b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.**

The p-value is \<0.0001 suggesting that the difference is statistically significant.

**5) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected\
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
in the pond (including previously infected fish).\
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.**\
Day 1 - 3/60, 0.05 cases per fish-day

Day 2 - 1/57, 0.018 cases per fish-day

Day 5 - 9/49, 0.184 cases per fish-day

**b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?**\
Day 3 - 7/60, 11.7% prevalence

Day 5 - 20/60, 33.3% prevalence

**c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?**\
Day 1

Anthony Starfield describes the importance and use of models in the field of wildlife management, but the use of models is just as helpful in the management of wildlife diseases. Using models as a learning tool instead of an answer, allows us to predict and better understand the spread of diseases. By collecting limited data on the disease, we can form a model that can forecast the spread based on predicted population and environmental factors, and from this predicted model, we can develop ideas on how to approach the containment, treatment, or response we should have to the disease. Based on these ideas developed from the model, we can alter it to see how the disease will react to the prevention attempts. This provides us with a great start to the challenges of dealing with a spreading disease. However, these models come with limits, as well as several assumptions which are applied to them. These limits include data uncertainty and ecological complexity, both of which are unavoidable issues that come with data collection and usefulness. Although we try our best to gather accurate and complete data, when investigating diseases in wildlife populations, there is always a rather large degree of uncertainty in the data due to our inability to gather data from full populations, take true random samples, or know to what extent the data is accurate. Ecological complexities also bring about limits in our modeling due to our inability to quantify all the possible factors from interactions between the environment, other wildlife, or people. This forces us to simplify these interactions, restricting the accuracy of the model. Models such as the compartmental SIR model also bring additional limits in the form of assumptions we must make about both the population in question and the process of the disease, such as closed populations, homogenous population mixing, infections don’t result in death, hosts are instantly infectious, and recovered individuals have lifelong immunity. All of the complexities and assumptions do not represent the real world, but even with all of these setbacks, modeling is an incredibly useful tool, especially when paired with other resources. Pairing modeling with real time disease monitoring provides us with the ability to constantly update the model, each time creating a model which is more accurate in its predictions. This is one of the great strengths of modeling, the ability to adapt the model to the real time disease systems unfolding in front of our eyes. Diseases can also be compared using these models, if we have access to models of previous diseases, we can compare them with current spreading diseases, and if they show similar patterns, we can use the same prevention tactics. This goes to show that modeling for wildlife disease management, along with additional resources and a well rounded knowledge of disease systems is an incredibly useful tool for wildlife managers and epidemiologists to understand how to handle diseases. While there is no guaranteed way to predict and prevent the spread of diseases, modeling gives a leg up on understanding the natural processes and assists in real time decision-making.

**Question 7**

**a. Based on these findings, how confident are you that none of the pups at these sites are exposed to *T. gondii*?**

We can not be confident without testing every single pup.

**b. How many more samples are necessary from the Olive Island population to be 99% confident that not a single pup has been exposed to *T. gondii*?**

35 mores samples.

**c. Estimate the upper bound of prevalence for exposure to *T. gondii* for each of these populations. Also, provide the confidence level for these prevalence values.**

Seal Bay - 95% Confidence Level that the prevalence is 3% or less.

Olive Island - 95% Confidence Level that the prevalence is 5% or less.

Dangerous Reef - 95% Confidence Level that the prevalence is 14% or less.

In this lab, we learned how to prepare and analyze a fecal sample. In the demonstration, we used cow feces. First, we separated 2 grams of the feces and added 13 mL of water to mix it up. After mixing the feces up, we separated the solids from the liquids. We then vortexed this liquid and added 1 mL of the freshly vortexed liquid to 1 mL of a sugar substance. This new solution can now be dropped into the observation slides. After letting the slide sit for 5 minutes we then put the slide under the microscope to identify any helminth eggs that might have been in the feces. The slide that I looked at only had two eggs in the feces, but that number is multiplied by 50 to get to 100 helminth eggs per gram of feces.

**1)** I would classify the Marburg virus as a Potential Emerging Infectious Disease because the transmission of bats to humans is relatively low while, the transmission from human to human seems to be relatively high as one patient was able to infect 65 others.

**2)** The first measure that should be enacted is the closing of the cave that the original patient entered, this will hopefully cut off any chances of anyone else potentially contracting the disease. The second would be to quarantine any patient with the disease and only come into contact with them with proper PPE and safety techniques. The community also needs to be alerted about the signs and symptoms of the virus, so that they have a chance to identify sick individuals and report them.

[Summary]{.underline} - The prevalence of the North is significantly smaller than that of the South and Central regions. The p-value shows that this difference is not likely just from chance. Female raccoons have a significantly higher prevalence than males, and once again the p-value shows that this difference is not likely just due to chance. However, when looking at the specific sexes in specific regions, only the South region shows that the difference between the sexes is statistically significant. So while the overall data shows that there is likely a connection between the number of females infected vs the males, I think it is unlikely due to the fact that only one region mirrored this. However, this could also likely be cleared up with the collection of more data. There is also no apparent connection between the likelihood of infection and age. Overall, it seems that the North region has a much lower prevalence of the roundworm, suggesting that there could be some environmental conditions inhibiting the spread or success of the roundworm.
